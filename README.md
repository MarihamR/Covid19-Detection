# Covid19-Detection

* This is an implementation of a course project conducted in June 2020 for the postgraduate course EC736-Neural Networks Applications.
* Code Implementation for binary classification (COVID-19 and pneumonia): [Covid_2Classes.ipynb](Covid_2Classes.ipynb)
* Code Implementation for multi-class classification, (COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal): [Covid_3Classes.ipynb](Covid_3Classes.ipynb)

## Dataset
Dataset used in this repo can be accessed through this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12nT-yTns2PAEZHf3B2XNL6V_nUfw-YHv/view)

A new chest X-ray dataset for COVID-19 detection was created by combining two existing datasets. First dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) consists of pneumonia and normal cases, while the second dataset from [Github](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) exclusively contains COVID-19 cases.
The constructed dataset facilitates the evaluation of models for two tasks: binary classification (COVID-19 and pneumonia) and multi-class classification, (COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal).
